# HotObservables
This project is the tenth part (and the last one) of a series of 10 articles about RxJava operators. It contains some examples about Hot Observables. The idea behind this app is to provide a playground where you can easily play around hot observables by connecting or disconnecting an observable as well as subscribing and unsubscribing a subscriber at any time making it easy and fun to discover how they behave and differ from each other.

Please, refer to [this article](http://androidahead.com/2018/02/17/rxjava-operators-part-10-hot-observables/) for detailed information.
